# Git Command Practice
Welcome to my Git playground! This repository is dedicated to mastering version control. It serves as a hands-on environment to practice commands, break things (safely), and learn how to fix them.
 The Basics
- git init - Initialize a new local repo.
- git status - Check the state of the working directory.
- git add . - Stage all changes.
- git commit -m "message" - Record changes to the repository.
